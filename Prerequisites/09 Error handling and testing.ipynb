   "source": "# Introduction\n\nIt is bad when a program crashes without an error message. It is even worse when a program used in \nengineering, science or finance computes an erroneous result. A crash without an informative error message causes\nfrustration, and it costs time because we get no information on what went wrong, and this makes it hard to fix. \nAn erroneous result used in an engineering design could risk life.\nWith good software engineering we can mitigate these risks.\n\n\n## Bugs and testing\n\nPrograms have bugs and users make mistakes. It is important to minimise the number of bugs,\nand where possible detect user mistakes. We do this through careful engineering of a program,\nerror checking and extensive (automated) testing. Testing is critical in engineering programs to build confidence that\na program computes the 'right' thing. Good software engineering and thorough testing would have prevented both the Patriot missile and Ariane 5 failures that were discussed in Activity 03.\n\nTesting is not a one-off exercise. As you develop programs, it is good practice to add tests as you go. It is also good to test very small units of a program so that if a test fails you can quickly narrow down the possible causes.\nModern software development uses *continuous integration*, in which a suite of tests is run every time a change is made to a code. This helps catch issues early. It also helps tremendously when more than one person is working on a program. You may add a feature today and test it, but tomorrow your colleague might make a seemingly unrelated change that breaks your feature. Continuous testing helps in this case.\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Introduction to raising exceptions\n- Use exception handling\n- Creation of tests",

   "source": "# Errors and exceptions\n\nThere are two types of program errors: *syntax errors* and *exceptions*.\n\n\n## Syntax errors\n\nSyntax errors are when the syntax of a program does not conform to the rules of the language. These are (generally) easy to detect because the interpreter/compiler will print an error. You will have seen plenty of syntax error messages by now!\n\n\n## Exceptions\n\nExceptions are when something unexpected or anomalous occurs during the execution of a program. The syntax is correct, but something goes\nwrong while a program is running. Simple examples, where a well-engineered program will *raise an exception*, include:\n\n- Attempting to divide by zero;\n- Receiving negative data when only positive data is permitted, e.g. taking the \n  log of a negative number, or a negative integer for the number students in a class;\n- Unexpected integer overflows; and\n- Attempting to compute the dot product between two vectors of different lengths.\n\nThese are all cases that can be tested in a program. We should check \nfor invalid data and attempts to use our programs beyond the limits of their designs,\nand in these cases raise an exception with an informative message.\n\n\n### USS Yorktown Smart Ship\n\nUSS Yorktown was used for the US Navy Smart Ship program. A computer system was fitted to operate a control \ncentre from the bridge. In 1997, a crew member entered data into the system that led to an attempted division \nby zero. This caused the ship's computer systems and the ship's propulsion systems to shut down.\nThis would have been avoided with good software engineering and exception handling.\nYou can find more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Yorktown_(CG-48)#Smart_ship_testbed.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/USS_Yorktown_%28CG-48%29%3B04014806.jpg\" width=\"400\" />",
